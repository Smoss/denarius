# World

## Shape
- world is a 2D grid of cells
  - each cell = 1 acre of land
- Each cell has a height determined by simplex noise
- Sea level is a height value determined by percent of land
- cells are divided into Provinces
  - generated by flood fill from random points on the map, each about the same size
- cells are divided into Biomes
  - generated by temperature and rainfall
- Provinces contain Districts, which are subdivisions
- Districts contain Property
- Property exists of a group of cells

## Rainfall
- Rivers (+++), Lakes (++), and coastal cells (+) produce rainfall in the general area

## Rivers
- generated using cellular automata
- drain into oceans, fill into lakes

## Biomes
- a collection of cells in the world

Types:
- Ocean: not used
- Forest: wood production
- Grassland: wheat production
- Lake: fish production
